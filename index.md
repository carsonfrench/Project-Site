## Poster Generator
Chloe, David, Nate, Carson, and Pei Pei

### Project Description

We want to create a GAN to generate movie posters, investigating if a neural network can create visually interesting and convincing art that we can use to decorate our dorms. 

This problem is hard because movie posters are usually focused on cohesive designs that center around a few important objects, whereas recently created generative art struggles with emphasis around clearly recognizable elements, instead focusing on emulating stylistic aspects of different genres.

We intend to experiment with specific styles of posters in order to generate designs that are visually appealing and use graphic design principles instead of just throwing a bunch of objects together.

We will most likely face many technical challenges. Right now one major challenge is finding a good dataset for posters.

Our results will hopefully generate decent looking posters and contribute to discourse about the role of AI in art and design.

Ethical implications: 
If we train an AI to generate posters based on existing movie posters, it raises the question of where credit should be given - is the AI artist responsible for the work? Furthermore, how close the results are to the training sets could result in plagiarism, and would the subsequent responsibilities lie on the AI or the creators?

This paper summarizes the different uses of General Adversarial Networks. GANs consist of a generator network which creates images and a discriminator network that determines if the image can be considered real or fake. They can be used to modify an existing image or create new images from a text input. Although basic GANs can create realistic images it is still difficult to generate high resolution images as well as video and 3D models.

4. [Visual Indeterminacy in GAN Art](https://direct.mit.edu/leon/article/53/4/424/96926/Visual-Indeterminacy-in-GAN-Art)

The author tackles the topic of visual indeterminacy in GAN art - the quality of images to appear real, but upon looking closer, are actually composed of elements that are unrecognizable. Many artworks generated by GAN models have details that can look real, such as human arms or tall skyscrapers, yet these details are not resolved fully and blend ambiguously into the background or into other objects. The author believes that this indeterminacy stems from imperfect generative models, as GANs at the moment are only capable of combining objects, textures, and backgrounds in an "uncanny valley" manner; models are not yet able to generate new compositions of these elements, and as a result, must rely on training images with similar, existing compositions. Subsequently, the resulting images are almost realistic, but fail to achieve certainty. Moving forward, the paper suggests conducting more research into vision neuroscience models and cortical modeling to better understand how visual indeterminacy can be manipulated in GAN artworks.

The authors of the paper propose a model that generates images in a given art style at multiple steps in the image creation process with the intention of revamping the process of creating art. The authors also introduce a new loss optimization method that works well for this use case of GANS.
