## Poster Generator
Chloe, David, Nate, Carson, and Pei Pei

### Project Description

We want to create a GAN to generate movie posters, investigating if a neural network can create visually interesting and convincing art that we can use to decorate our dorms.
This problem is hard because movie posters are usually focused on cohesive designs that center around a few important objects, whereas recently created generative art struggles with emphasis around clearly recognizable elements, instead focusing on emulating stylistic aspects of different genres.
We intend to experiment with specific styles of posters in order to generate designs that are visually appealing and use graphic design principles instead of just throwing a bunch of objects together.
We will most likely face many technical challenges. Right now one major challenge is finding a good dataset for posters.
Our results will hopefully generate decent looking posters and contribute to discourse about the role of AI in art and design.
Ethical implications: 
If we train an AI to generate posters based on existing movie posters, it raises the question of where credit should be given - is the AI artist responsible for the work? Furthermore, how close the results are to the training sets could result in plagiarism, and would the subsequent responsibilities lie on the AI or the creators?
